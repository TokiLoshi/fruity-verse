# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is being built out for a Three.js journey challenge. The theme for February 2024 is a solar system. I thought I would build a quirky fruity-verse.

Welcome to the fruity verse! You are a space whale trapped in the fruity verse. Upon your arrival you are exhausted and need to refuel. But the solar sytem you have arrived in is home to a giant black hole that is busy consuming everything around it. To escape you must eat enough fruit to get energy to go to the next solar system and escape the black hole. Who will win, the whale or the supermassive black hole? Let's find out.

Packages used:

- big thanks to Poimandres for the eslint configuration - this helps keep me sane.
