# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is being built out for a Three.js journey challenge. The theme for February 2024 is a solar system. I thought I would build a quirky fruity-verse.

[x] - Deploy to Vercel
[] - Dragon fruit planet model

- big thanks to Poimandres for the eslint configuration - this helps keep me sane.
